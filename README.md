# 20220101 soladay

attempting to deploy one ethereum smart contract a day

first up is a contract to keep track of every deployed contract during this challenge.

that means local storage with pointers to deployed contract addresses
// mapping uint256 => address (assuming uint256 is best way to store a date?)

I'll be working in hardhat and javascript for now, maybe replit.

how do I register myself?

well, each soladay contract needs a soladay function that we can call to retrieve the name / date / other info?

so an interface?

let's uh.. get started
